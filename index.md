	<h3><u>Update</u></h3>
	<p><b>My project is up to date and going exactly like mentioned in the schedule and proposal. I didn't buy anything extra outside the budget mentioned.</b>

	<p><b>PCB Power up.</b>
	<p>This image shows how my pcb actually works.

	<p>I captured these two output in which one image shows the distance of the object to the sensor which is 3.7cm and the other image shows the distance of 13.33cm. I also placed the ruler between the senor and the object to check if the sensor is measuring the distance displayed on the LCD is correct and as a result it was measuring accurately.

	<p><b>To test the connection, I connected the VCC and ground with the multimeter. It shows Overload which means connection is open. </b>

	<p><b>I made the connection using HC-SR04 sensor, LCD disaply, Breadboard and Raspberry Pi.</b>
	<br>

	<br>
	<p><b>I got this output on the terminal window of the Raspberry Pi.</b>

	<p><b>Whereas, when an object moves near the HC-SR04 sensor it displays the distance on the LCD Screen in cm. </b>
